The sphero contains multiple sensors, including a velocity, light, and speed sensor. The light sensor works by monitoring the lumens in it's vicinity and taking note of it. You can program the bolt to use the light sensor in many ways, because it uses the lumens around it, the sphero is pretty accurate. One way I used the li8ght sensor was to program it to notice if the light around it has been dimmed, and if it had, it would play a matrix animation.

I believe that setting up journals was quite easy, at least for me. I didn't have many problems with the set up, other than everything being very specific. I guess that was one of the issues, since alot of people don't pay attention in class, they didn't pay attention to the small details in which was required when you set up your journal. For me, I had accidentally added an extra character at the end of the title of my repository, that leaded to my journal not being graded. It wasn't the teachers fault, for I belive she did nothing wrong. Overall, the process went pretty smoothly for me.

Today for the hour of coding assignment, I created my own google logo. It was pretty fun.

I believe that follwing code instructions is vital to making sure your program runs smoothly. For example, if you mistype something, or use the wrong command, a number of errors may occur as a result of the code not being precise. It's important to develop good habits because they can help you in the long run, like helping you catch mistakes faster and gernerally making the coding experience faster and smoother. In order to have a good program, you must be precise as well. In cases such as those where you have to go through certain steps to acheive a desriable outcome, being sloppy and not focused with your work may result in your program being incomplete.

In my daily life, computers play a vital role. Even in matters such as waking up do i use a computer. I use an alarm clock to wake myself up in the morning, which is basically a mini computer. I think computer science is everywhere in my life, primarily on my phone because it's something i use pretty often. Computers are present in the car i use to get to school, the laptop i use. even the very thing I'm typing on. I don't really know how i would really do anything without computers, i'm not one for getting up and about much. I love the convienence of computers, and they're the best to me.

I researched backend server development. A few responsibilities are building and maintaining code, designing and managing databases, developing APIs, and optimizing website performance. I also need to be able to know programming languages like Python, Java, and PHP. I need to have in-depth knowledge of database administration and database management systems. I also need knowledge of Application Programming Interfaces (APIs), which allow computers to communicate with each other. Lastly, I need to know web frameworks like Django, Spring Boot, Express.js, and Ruby on Rails. I need at least a bachelor's degree in computer science. There are not many opportunities for advancement in this job as this is the highest position. This job makes alot of money, so that's why i want to do it :).

Coding can improve problem dolving skills by giving you situations in which you are forced to use problem solving skills. There will be multiple instances in which your code won't work, and it's going to be up to you to debug and such. Coding enhances creativity because there is never just one answer to a solution. When you are forced to work together and code, it will enhance your collaboration skills greatly. Even just asking for help from someone such as a teacher whilst coding can help your collaboration skills. Coding will directly influence my future career because I will be coding anc collaborating alot as a back end developer.

  Ai can help improve efficiency in workplaces such as healthcare by being able to detect when paitents are not feeling well and notifying healthcare providers in such an instance. It can even help teachers be more efficient when grading scholar's schoolwork and such. AI can also help transportation workers such as bus drivers generate the most effective route to  get to a certain area.
  Though AI has much benefits, it is also very, notoriously unreliable. It can be biased sometimes, depending on wheter it's programmer may be biased as well. It can also have many errors, and not be as effective as a skilled human. It can also pose privacy threats in places it is used.

  With things such as technology and social media, people no longer have to go out in rallies and physically taxing events for they can just stay at home and watch everything occurr online. With almost everything in the world acessible to most people in the form of the internet, it makes it easy for people to find a canidate who aligns with their personal beliefs.Yet, it also makes it easy for misinformation to be spread. But if people are smart and choose to do their proper research, they will find the best canidate.

  It is important to keep your personal information sensitive and private when posting things online because your information can easily be used by hackers and other bad people to exploit you. You can have a very strong passwords on websites such as github and social media to insure your information is private and safe. I don't post at all on social media so no. You can use a fake name whilst working with others online, or you could simply refrain from sharing sensitive information over the internet.

   An event that interests me is the use of AI for entertainment. I see the use of physical AI robots alot online for entertainment and it really interests me. I saw a video the other day where some dude "won" against a robot at chess, and i couldn't help but wonder if it was scripted. It baffles me that a robot with access to like a million different moves in chess lost to a human. It had to be pre-programmed to lose, or something like that. It relates to the stuff we're learning in the sense that the AI would use data analysis to pick the best move for it to play.
   Advancements in computer science won't really be able to help or change this event for it was already scripted to happen. I can't imagine a possible outcome where the advancements of technology could stop a scripted event from happening, for how could a program change itself? How could a program change the fate already laid out for it? It can't, and that's the beauty of humanity for we have the power to change our fate, to choose out own path instead of following the one pre laid out for us.

Renewable energy technologies such as wind turbines and solar panels are very quickly being intergrated into our daily lives. The lfiespan of such things like wind turbines are far longer than simple, disposable energy sources that we are so used to. Solar panels are not only efficient but they also give you a nice tax return. Its a great solution for people who wish to save on their energy bill and also lessen the carbon footprint they will leave on the world. Such technologies can impact society by greatly reducing our carbon emmisions if effectively used and input through the world. Such technology is pretty exciting because instead of using up energy sources such as fossil fuels which can never come back, we are able to utilize the gift of mother nature by using energy from the wind and the sun.

The term "brain rot", to me, is something that reminds me of all the stupid things i see online. Wether it be video's with inchoherent captions or maybe a silly video of a cat dancing, the term always comes to mind when I see the wonders of the internet. The internet has had a positive impact on my mental wellbeing for it always manages to entertain me when i really need it. I don't think I have been too impacted by the things I see online. The runner up word, "lore", is one that definently describes the 2024 internet expierence very greatly. Though the term is thrown around loosely and uses as more so a joke than anything, it's one that is very heavily used as of the current moment. In my opinion, I do think it is very important to try your best to balance a work-internet relationship as best you can. I cannot say that I am perfect in this regard but I will say that I do try my hardest to not let my love of funny things online get in the way of me doing my work and such. If you want to avoid "brain rot", then it is best to stay away from the parasite that is social media completely.
