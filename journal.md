The sphero contains multiple sensors, including a velocity, light, and speed sensor. The light sensor works by monitoring the lumens in it's vicinity and taking note of it. You can program the bolt to use the light sensor in many ways, because it uses the lumens around it, the sphero is pretty accurate. One way I used the li8ght sensor was to program it to notice if the light around it has been dimmed, and if it had, it would play a matrix animation.

I believe that setting up journals was quite easy, at least for me. I didn't have many problems with the set up, other than everything being very specific. I guess that was one of the issues, since alot of people don't pay attention in class, they didn't pay attention to the small details in which was required when you set up your journal. For me, I had accidentally added an extra character at the end of the title of my repository, that leaded to my journal not being graded. It wasn't the teachers fault, for I belive she did nothing wrong. Overall, the process went pretty smoothly for me.

I believe that follwing code instructions is vital to making sure your program runs smoothly. For example, if you mistype something, or use the wrong command, a number of errors may occur as a result of the code not being precise. It's important to develop good habits because they can help you in the long run, like helping you catch mistakes faster and gernerally making the coding experience faster and smoother. In order to have a good program, you must be precise as well. In cases such as those where you have to go through certain steps to acheive a desriable outcome, being sloppy and not focused with your work may result in your program being incomplete.

In my daily life, computers play a vital role. Even in matters such as waking up do i use a computer. I use an alarm clock to wake myself up in the morning, which is basically a mini computer. I think computer science is everywhere in my life, primarily on my phone because it's something i use pretty often. Computers are present in the car i use to get to school, the laptop i use. even the very thing I'm typing on. I don't really know how i would really do anything without computers, i'm not one for getting up and about much. I love the convienence of computers, and they're the best to me.

I researched backend server development. A few responsibilities are building and maintaining code, designing and managing databases, developing APIs, and optimizing website performance. I also need to be able to know programming languages like Python, Java, and PHP. I need to have in-depth knowledge of database administration and database management systems. I also need knowledge of Application Programming Interfaces (APIs), which allow computers to communicate with each other. Lastly, I need to know web frameworks like Django, Spring Boot, Express.js, and Ruby on Rails. I need at least a bachelor's degree in computer science. There are not many opportunities for advancement in this job as this is the highest position. This job makes alot of money, so that's why i want to do it :).

Coding can improve problem dolving skills by giving you situations in which you are forced to use problem solving skills. There will be multiple instances in which your code won't work, and it's going to be up to you to debug and such. Coding enhances creativity because there is never just one answer to a solution. When you are forced to work together and code, it will enhance your collaboration skills greatly. Even just asking for help from someone such as a teacher whilst coding can help your collaboration skills. Coding will directly influence my future career because I will be coding anc collaborating alot as a back end developer.
