The sphero contains multiple sensors, including a velocity, light, and speed sensor. The light sensor works by monitoring the lumens in it's vicinity and taking note of it. You can program the bolt to use the light sensor in many ways, because it uses the lumens around it, the sphero is pretty accurate. One way I used the li8ght sensor was to program it to notice if the light around it has been dimmed, and if it had, it would play a matrix animation.
