The sphero contains multiple sensors, including a velocity, light, and speed sensor. The light sensor works by monitoring the lumens in it's vicinity and taking note of it. You can program the bolt to use the light sensor in many ways, because it uses the lumens around it, the sphero is pretty accurate. One way I used the li8ght sensor was to program it to notice if the light around it has been dimmed, and if it had, it would play a matrix animation.

I believe that setting up journals was quite easy, at least for me. I didn't have many problems with the set up, other than everything being very specific. I guess that was one of the issues, since alot of people don't pay attention in class, they didn't pay attention to the small details in which was required when you set up your journal. For me, I had accidentally added an extra character at the end of the title of my repository, that leaded to my journal not being graded. It wasn't the teachers fault, for I belive she did nothing wrong. Overall, the process went pretty smoothly for me.

I believe that follwing code instructions is vital to making sure your program runs smoothly. For example, if you mistype something, or use the wrong command, a number of errors may occur as a result of the code not being precise. It's important to develop good habits because they can help you in the long run, like helping you catch mistakes faster and gernerally making the coding experience faster and smoother. In order to have a good program, you must be precise as well. In cases such as those where you have to go through certain steps to acheive a desriable outcome, being sloppy and not focused with your work may result in your program being incomplete.
